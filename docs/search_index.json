We developed and evaluated a run timing forecast model for the Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon stock, located in western Alaska, intended to aid in reducing this source of uncertainty. An objective and adaptive approach (using model-averaging and a sliding window algorithm to select predictive time periods, both calibrated annually) was adopted to deal with multidimensional selection of four climatic variables and was based entirely on predictive performance. Forecast cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of three forecasting approaches: the null (i.e., intercept only) model, the single model with the lowest mean absolute error, and a model-averaged forecast across 16 nested linear models. As of 2016, the null model had the lowest mean absolute error (2.64 days), although the model-averaged forecast performed as well or better than the null model in the majority of retrospective years. The model-averaged forecast had a consistent mean absolute error regardless of the type of year (i.e., average or extreme early/late) the forecast was made for, which was not true of the null model. The availability of the run timing forecast was not found to increase overall accuracy of in-season run assessments in relation to the null model, but was found to substantially increase the precision of these assessments, particularly early in the season. 2.1 Introduction In-season management strategies for Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) fisheries rely heavily on indices of in-river abundance (e.g., test fisheries, sonar counts, etc.) to inform harvest control rules that attempt to attain the balance of meeting pre-determined escapement objectives while allowing adequate opportunity for harvest (Catalano and Jones 2014). However, because indices of abundance are confounded by the phenology (i.e., timing) of the migration, their interpretation is very difficult in-season. For example, smaller-than-average index values early in the season could be due to either a small run with average timing or by a late large run, when interpreted in the context of historical years (Adkison and Cunningham 2015). This ultimately leads to great uncertainty about how much of the incoming run has passed, which is a key piece of information that dictates fishery harvest opportunities. There exists no information in the current year’s abundance index to inform the manager if (for example) 25% or 75% of the run has passed on any given day. Yet, depending which is true, the optimal management decision could be vastly different. Thus, in-season assessment typically involves some characterization of the variation in historical run timing to formulate a range of possible run size scenarios that could be representative of the current year’s run size. However, given the amount of variation in historical run timing, these scenarios are rarely informative during the majority of the migration, when key harvest decisions are being made because the run scenarios may span all possible run sizes. As a result, the pre-season run size forecast remains the most precise piece of information for much of the season. If it were possible to predict the timing of the incoming run (e.g., earlier- or later-than-average) with some level of confidence, it could prove valuable for in-season assessment and decision-making by reducing uncertainty in run size predictions. While previous research has uncovered several key physiological mechanisms that are involved with natal homing (Hasler and Scholz, 1983) and return migrations of adult salmon to freshwater environments (Cooperman et al., 2010; Cooke et al., 2008; Hinch et al., 2012), the exact physiological and behavioral responses of adult salmon to relatively small-scale environmental gradients within estuaries, which are likely the ultimate determinants of freshwater entry timing, are still poorly understood. Despite this uncertainty, several hypotheses have been put forth that are broadly consistent with the observed timing patterns of several species across a large geographic area (i.e., western and southwestern Alaska). Two primary influences have been suggested: genetic (Quinn et al., 2000; Anderson and Beer, 2009; O’Malley et al., 2010) and environmental (Hodgson et al., 2006; Keefer et al., 2008) mechanisms. Substantial evidence exists to suggest that both genetic and environmental controls are involved in determining migration timing, however it is broadly thought that genetic variation influences sub-stock variation (i.e., different tributary spawning groups within the same major river basin) and environmental variation influences the timing of the aggregate (i.e., basin-wide) run (Keefer et al., 2008; Anderson and Beer, 2009). This is consistent with the notion that genetically distinct components of the aggregate run behave differently as a result of their life history strategies and/or the characteristics of their specific spawning grounds (e.g., sub-stocks that must travel farther in-river to reach spawning grounds enter freshwater earlier [Clark et al., 2015]; sub-stocks that spawn in tributaries influenced by warmer lakes enable later spawning; Burger et al., 1985) but that certain environmental conditions act on the aggregate run to either hasten or delay freshwater entry. It has also been suggested that run size may have an influence on migration timing, although empirical support for this claim seems to be lacking. If there were indeed relationships between run timing and run size, these need to be quantified as certain combinations are particularly troublesome for managers (e.g., small/early runs and large/late runs appear the same early in-season; Adkison and Cunningham, 2015). At the aggregate population scale, which is the focus of this paper, it has been observed that migrations occurring in the spring and summer generally occur earlier in years with warmer spring temperatures (Mundy and Evenson, 2011; Hodgson et al., 2006). Mundy and Evenson (2011) suggested that this pattern may be explained by the stability of the estuarine water column where adult salmon stage in preparation for riverine entry (or alternatively, marine exit). High estuarine water column stability was hypothesized to impede riverine entry through two mechanisms: (1) by presenting an osmotic barrier between freshwater riverine discharge and the saline ocean water which prevents osmotically incompetent individuals from crossing and (2) by preventing freshwater competent individuals from receiving olfactory cues essential to the homeward migration. Thus, Mundy and Evenson (2011) hypothesized that years in which the estuarine water column is stable over a longer period of time would be associated with later migration timing. Although water column stability is a difficult variable to measure over large spatial scales, several variables that are known to influence it are available at large scales via remote sensing (e.g., satellite observations). Such variables are sea ice cover which prevents wind-driven mixing, associated local temperature-related variables like land-based air temperature or sea surface temperature (SST), and broader scale indicators such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), an index of temperature anomalies in the northern Pacific Ocean. Observational studies across the North American range of Chinook salmon have found environmental-run timing correlations that are consistent with this hypothesis (Hodgson et al., 2006; Keefer et al., 2008; Mundy and Evenson, 2011). Even if the water column stability hypothesis is incorrect, observed patterns suggest that environmental variables may be used to forecast run timing with some level of accuracy and certainty. Several efforts have been made at exploiting these environmental-run timing relationships to develop run timing forecast models for Pacific salmon migrations. Mundy and Evenson (2011) developed a model for Yukon River Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) that used air temperature, sea surface temperature, and ice cover to predict the day at which the 15th and 50th percentiles of the run passed a test fishery index location. Model predictions fit the observed data well (nearly always within seven days, usually within three days), although out-of-sample predictive ability was not presented (Mundy and Evenson, 2011). Keefer et al. (2008) developed a similar framework for Columbia River spring run Chinook salmon and found run timing relationships with river discharge, river temperature, and ocean condition indices (e.g., PDO). Their best model explained 49% of the variation in median run timing with variation in the environmental variables. Anderson and Beer (2009) continued this work on the Columbia River spring Chinook stock, but added genetic components to their analysis based on the arrival timing of precocious males. Their findings revealed that both environmental variables and changes in abundance of genetically distinct populations, which had their own distinct migration timing, affected overall run timing of the spring Chinook salmon run in the Columbia River. These advancements have shown that relationships between migration timing and environmental variables exist and may have utility for use in forecasting efforts. The Kuskokwim River, located in western Alaska, is the second largest river system in the state and supports culturally and economically important Chinook salmon fisheries. Chinook salmon return beginning in late May and continue through early August, with the median date of passage occurring between June 14th and July 2nd. Fisheries within the region harvest salmon in-river during freshwater migrations using primarily drift gillnet gear. The Kuskokwim River salmon fishery has a distinct cultural importance: nearly all inhabitants are native Alaskans belonging to the Yup’ik group and take salmon for subsistence purposes (Linderman and Bergstrom, 2009). While commercial salmon fisheries operate within the river, these fishers often also participate in subsistence take and revenues from the sale of commercially-harvested salmon often contribute directly to participation in subsistence activities (Wolfe and Spaeder, 2009). To ensure long-term sustainable harvest, the Chinook salmon fishery is managed with a drainage-wide escapement goal derived from an age-structured state-space spawner-recruit analysis (Hamazaki et al., 2012; Staton et al., 2017). To meet these pre-determined escapement goals, in-season management strategies implement time, gear, and area closures based on limited and imprecise information regarding annual run size. The distant locations of the majority of escapement assessment projects makes direct measurement of escapement performance unavailable until late in the season. Thus, the primary sources of run size assessment information are (1) a pre-season run size forecast range (previous year’s run size estimate +/- approximately 20%) and (2) an in-river drift gillnet test fishery operated in Bethel, AK which has been implemented using consistent methods since 1984. The interpretation of this test fishery index suffers from the same issue of being confounded by run timing described earlier, making management decisions difficult. Without precise in-season indicators of run size, managers must often choose to either (1) trust a pre-season run size forecast for the majority of the season or (2) take their chances at deciding if the run is early or late when interpreting in-season data. Both options could lead to the wrong interpretation of the actual run size, which could have serious consequences for the management of the fishery (i.e., the unwarranted opening or closing the fishery resulting in severe under- or over-escapement). No published run timing forecast models currently exist for Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon but given the potential utility of independent run timing estimates for interpretation of in-season data, the development and evaluation of such a model is needed. The necessity of more accurate and precise in-season perceptions of run size is particularly evident in years with anticipated low runs, such as in recent years (i.e., since 2010), as this may allow managers to more effectively guard against over-exploitation while still allowing for limited harvest opportunities to support the cultural and subsistence needs of the region. We present an analysis that develops and evaluates the performance of a run timing forecast model for Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon. The objectives were to (1) quantify historical run timing, (2) develop a run timing forecast model using environmental variables selected based on out-of-sample predictive performance, (3) assess the utility of the forecasting model for improving predictions of end-of-season test fishery indices of run size, and (4) determine if there is a relationship between run size and run timing for the Kuskokwim River Chinook salmon stock. 2.2 Methods 2.2.1 Estimates of migration timing In this analysis, the forecasted quantity that represented migration timing was the day at which 50% of the run passed an index location (hereafter, \\(D_{50}\\)). To inform this quantity for each year in the analysis, we used daily catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from the Bethel Test Fishery (BTF) operated by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG), which spans 1984 – 2016. The raw data were daily CPUE beginning on 1 June and ending 24 August each year. The cumulative sum of these daily CPUE values within a year follows a sigmoidal pattern reflecting the shape of the incoming salmon run which is characterized by relatively few early migrants, a peak where the majority of the fish are running, and relatively few late migrants. To estimate the median day of passage as a continuous variable, a logistic model was fitted to the cumulative proportion of daily CPUE of the form: \\[\\begin{equation} p_{d,t}=\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-h_t (d - D_{50,t})}}, \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_{d,t}\\) is the predicted cumulative proportion on Julian day \\(d\\) in calendar year \\(t\\), \\(h_t\\) is the parameter that controls the steepness of the curve (i.e., duration of the run), and \\(D_{50,t}\\) is the day at which 50% of the total annual CPUE was caught in year \\(t\\). Annual estimates of \\(D_{50,t}\\) and \\(h_t\\) were obtained by fitting \\(p_{d,t}\\) to observed daily cumulative proportion by minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the model prediction. Uncertainty in these parameter estimates was not further considered in the analysis as the uncertainty was negligible. Further, by using the BTF daily values to infer the location and shape of year-specific logistic timing curves, we made the assumption that these data provided an accurate representation of daily run strength within a year (influence of weather conditions or harvest on sampling was negligible). 2.2.2 Environmental variables Environmental variables to be assessed for forecasting performance were chosen based on: previously established association with salmon run timing, availability for the Kuskokwim River during the years for which BTF index observations exist (1984 – 2016), and availability for use in a pre-season forecast model (i.e., available no later than June 10th in the year for which the forecasted value would be used). Based on these criteria, four environmental variables were chosen for analysis: SST, percent sea ice cover (SIC), PDO, and land-based air temperature taken in Bethel, AK. 2.2.2.1 PDO data Data collected for the PDO variable came from one of several indices produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Mantua et al., 1997; http://research.jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest.txt). The index is produced by taking the first principal component of monthly SST anomalies in the northern Pacific Ocean, after removing any global trends due to any systematic change over time (Mantua et al., 1997). Thus, for each year of the data set, a single monthly value was available for PDO. In the selection of relevant time periods (Section 2.3), we considered monthly PDO values from January to June of each year, as previous studies have found PDO values prior to the initiation of the run have predictive value for Chinook salmon populations (Beer, 2007; Keefer et al., 2008). 2.2.2.2 Bethel air temperature data Air temperature data for Bethel, AK were accessed from the Alaska Climate Research Center (http://akclimate.org/acis_data). These data were available as daily means for each day of each year in the 1984 – 2016 data set. Daily air temperature values from the start of January to mid-June of each year were considered in the selection procedures. 2.2.2.3 SST and SIC SST and SIC data were accessed from the NOAA Optimum Interpolation SST V2 High Resolution Dataset (Reynolds et al., 2007; http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html). These data were available as daily means for any 0.25° by 0.25° latitude by longitude grid cell on the globe. To limit the search, only grid cells within Kuskokwim Bay were selected for analysis (Figure 1) as that is the area that Chinook salmon bound for the Kuskokwim River likely aggregate prior to riverine entry. The area with grid cells ranged from 58.5° N to 60° N by 164.25° W to 162° W, which resulted in a total of 54 0.25° latitude by 0.25° longitude grid cells. For SST, four grid cells fell partially over land (resulting in 50 grid cells with daily data) and for SIC, five grid cells were partially over land (49 grid cells with daily data). “Empty” grid cells were excluded and the remaining grid cells were used for prediction. Previous analyses have used a simple average over a wide spatial area (e.g., Mundy and Evenson, 2011) to create a single value for SST or SIC each year. However, this is somewhat arbitrary and does not account for the possibility of certain areas having stronger timing signals than others or that these areas with stronger signals may change over time. Thus, the gridded spatial structure of these variables was retained and the treatment of this structure in the forecast analysis is discussed below in Section 2.4. Because of the time-intensive nature of the selection procedure described in Section 2.3, considered time periods for gridded variables were shortened based on preliminary correlation analyses showing excluded times had little or no correlation with D50. Daily means for SST from mid-April to mid-June and SIC from mid-February to mid-May in each year were considered in the predictive variable selection techniques. 2.2.3 Selection of predictive time periods Climatic variables are frequently associated with biological quantities for the purpose of prediction, however, oftentimes the average over an arbitrary time period, such as daily values in the month of February, is used based on a priori assumptions of the behavior of important factors (van de Pol et al., 2016). While this approach is simple to implement and explain, it is possible that a better time window (i.e., reliably more accurate) exists but is not considered. Furthermore, the importance of various time windows may change over time and the arbitrary selection of a single window does not allow for such changes to be detected. To avoid these issues, a rigorous temporal selection process, known as the sliding window algorithm (van de Pol et al., 2016), was implemented to determine the best predictive time period for each variable considered in the forecast model. To find the most reliable temporal window for prediction, this method evaluates all possible windows (subject to certain restrictions) over which to average for use in the forecast model. As input constraints, the sliding window algorithm used in this analysis required: (1) the start date of the first window to be evaluated, (2) the end date of the last window to be evaluated, and (3) the minimum window size of a candidate window. It then proceeded to evaluate all possible combinations of window averages (using only consecutive days). For example, if the start date of the first possible window was set to 1 May, the minimum window size was set to five days, and the end date of the last possible window was set to 30 May, the window algorithm would start by averaging the daily values between 1 May and 5 May for each year separately and would evaluate the predictive performance of that variable using forecast cross-validation (described below). Next, the algorithm would begin to increase the window size by one day on each iteration, averaging daily values and evaluating the predictive performance for 1 May to 6 May, then 1 May to 7 May, and so on, until it reached the largest window starting with 1 May (which would be 1 May to 30 May). Following completion of all windows starting with 1 May, the algorithm would proceed to evaluate all possible windows starting with 2 May, then 3 May, and so on, until it reached windows starting with 26 May. At this point, there would only be one window to be evaluated, since the minimum number of days to include in a candidate window was set at five days. In the analysis, five days was used as the minimum window size for all variables except PDO (which had monthly values), in which case the minimum window size was set such that a single month could constitute a window. Example R code for how the sliding window algorithm was implemented is provided in Appendix A. All windows were evaluated using a time series forecast cross-validation procedure, which is an out-of-sample technique for data that are collected through time (Arlot and Celisse, 2010). The procedure operated by producing a forecasted value of \\(D_{50}\\) for year \\(t+1\\) trained based on all data available from years \\(1,..., t\\). It then continued for all \\(t = m, ..., n-1\\), where \\(m\\) is the minimum number of years necessary to fit the model (set at \\(m = 10\\) in all cases) and \\(n\\) is the number of years of available data. Then, absolute forecast error in \\(D_{50}\\) was calculated based on all forecasted years as \\(|y_{t+1} - \\hat{y}_{t+1}|\\), and yearly forecast errors were averaged to obtain mean absolute error (\\(\\overline{AE}\\)) which was used as the measure of model performance in window selection. The window with the lowest (\\(\\overline{AE}\\)) was selected as the optimal window to average over for prediction. The forecasting cross-validation procedure was used as opposed to other out-of-sample validation procedures, such as \\(k\\)-fold or leave-one-out methods, because the data were collected through time and it does not make sense for the model to need to predict (for example) year 2010 from years 1984 – 2009 and 2011 – 2016, but rather it would always need to predict year \\(t+1\\) from all previously-collected data. Example R code for how the forecast cross-validation was conducted is provided in Appendix A. Although a recent R package has been released to conduct sliding climate window analyses (“climwin”; Bailey and van de Pol, 2015), the package can currently only assess candidate windows using Akiake’s Information Criterion (AIC) or k-fold cross-validation. Because the more specialized forecasting cross-validation technique was required for this analysis, custom R code was written to select the optimal window for each variable (Appendix A). When forecasting D50,t+1 from training data from 1, …, t, a single optimal climate window was selected for each variable and that window was used to estimate coefficients based on training data and obtain the environmental variable value for prediction in year t+1 to forecast D50,t+1. When a new year of data was added to the training data (such as in the retrospective forecast analysis; Section 2.7), the optimal window for each variable was re-assessed using the algorithm again. For PDO and Bethel air temperature, which had no spatial structure, the sliding window algorithm was used to select the range of monthly (PDO) or daily (Bethel air temperature) values to include in the predictive climate window for each year in the analysis. For SST and SIC which contained a series of 50 and 49 grid cells, respectively, each with unique daily values, the sliding window algorithm was used on each grid cell separately. The result was 50 unique grid cell-specific windows for SST and 49 windows for SIC for each year of the analysis. The treatment of this spatial structure in the forecast analysis is discussed below in Section @ref(rtf-models}. References "],
