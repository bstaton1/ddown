The structure of these systems is complex (both biologically and sociologically), and capturing that complexity is not the objective of this figure. Rather it is to provide a framework for thinking about where key decisions and uncertainties fall in the big picture. Different resource scientists and managers may have different ways of thinking about this structure; however, this is how I have organized the pieces in my thinking and this proposal.}}{8}{figure.1.1}
